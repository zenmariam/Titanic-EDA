 Exploratory data analysis and model building. 

In this project we build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

I have fitted three models : Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes for the classifaction.
The project is mailny divided into parts: processing the data i.e. The Exproratory Data Analysis and Model Building.
